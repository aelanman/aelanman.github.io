I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, working with the CHIME/FRB collaboration in the discovery and localization of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). My main research activities are building radio telescope arrays, characterizing Fast Radio Burst signals, and using them to study the large-scale structure of baryonic matter in the universe. More broadly, I am interested in what the universe looks like at low frequencies, and how to build newer and better tools for studying the radio domain.

I earned my PhD in December of 2019 from Brown University, working with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) collaborations to build instruments to detect the faint radio emission of hydrogen from the early universe. Prior to my current position I was a postdoc at McGill University, which is where I got started with the CHIME collaboration. I live in Somerville with my wife, Jessica, and our cat, Callie. We're both from White Plains, NY, originally. In my free time I like to do crossword puzzles, juggle, bicycle, and I'm learning to play guitar (poorly).
