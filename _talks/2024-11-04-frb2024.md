Abstract
========

The CHIME/FRB Outriggers project promises to massively accelerate the rate at which FRB host galaxies are identified. The k’niʔatn k’l‿stk’masqt outrigger (KKO) in Princeton, BC, Canada, is located 66~km from CHIME, forming a baseline capable of localizing FRBs to arcsecond precision in right ascension, which is sufficient to identify FRB host galaxies when combined with arcminute-scale localization from CHIME's baseband system. Since it began full science operations a year ago, KKO has recorded data for an average of five FRB events each week, as well as dozens of pulsar bursts for diagnostic and testing purposes. Here, we present an early sample of host galaxies for 20 FRBs localized using VLBI between CHIME and KKO, including the first-ever non-repeating FRBs detected in VLBI. I will discuss the operational stability of KKO, the data analysis pipeline, and notable examples from this early host galaxy sample.
