Abstract
========

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, first discovered in 2007. Their exact nature remains a tantalizing mystery, as several plausible progenitors are consistent with current observations. FRBs can be used as a unique probe of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media, since the dispersion, scattering, and scintillation observed in FRB spectra are related to the density, structure, and ionization state of plasma along the line of sight. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) in British Columbia is the fastest FRB detector in the world, discovering on average three new FRBs every day. To date, CHIME/FRB has published hundreds of FRB spectra and identified dozens of new repeating FRBs, enabling numerous insights into FRB progenitors and environments. Although CHIME/FRB has excellent characteristics for detecting FRBs, it lacks the sub-arcsecond resolution required to identify their host galaxies. Three new outrigger antennas, spread across North America, will enable CHIME to perform very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) on FRB candidates at detection, effectively combining the discovery rate of CHIME with the resolution of VLBI. In this talk, I will discuss FRB science in general, the outrigger commissioning process, early VLBI results, and the scientific potential of localized FRBs.
