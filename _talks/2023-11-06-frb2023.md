Abstract
========

The CHIME/FRB outrigger program aims to add VLBI-localization capabilities to CHIME, such that FRBs may be localized to tens of milliarcsec precision at the time of their discovery, enabling host galaxy identification. The first outrigger telescope is the k’niʔatn k’l‿stk’masqt outrigger (KKO), located 66 kilometers from CHIME to allow for arcsec-scale resolution. KKO has been in commissioning since it saw first light in June 2022. In addition to demonstrating the scientific potential of KKO, the commissioning efforts have helped enormously with preparing the next outrigger telescope. In this talk I will discuss the results of commissioning tests at KKO, including measurements of system noise and the RFI environment, tests of system stability and robustness in its remote location, and some results of VLBI cross-correlation with CHIME.
