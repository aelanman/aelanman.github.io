Abstract
========

Feedback has widespread consequences for the evolution of galaxies and groups: redistributing gas from galactic disks into the outer reaches of circumgalactic regions and ejecting baryons entirely from low-mass halos. The baryons in the circumgalactic and intragroup media (CGM/IGrM) remain difficult to observe because of their low densities and emissivities. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures (DMs), directly measure electron column density along the line of sight, and thus are sensitive to the otherwise hidden baryonic matter. Using the 21 low-redshift FRB host galaxies from the first CHIME/FRB Outriggers catalog, all localized using the first station KKO, I will present two applications to the study of galaxy environments. First, we estimate host-galaxy CGM contributions to FRB DMs with a carefully selected subsample, finding tension with simulations that employ weak feedback prescriptions in the CAMELS suite. Second, in a unique case where a single FRB sightline intersects three galaxy group halos, the total DM constrains the intragroup baryon fraction to <40% of the cosmic value within R_{500} for logM ~ 13 halos, in conflict with prior X-ray constraints but consistent with recent eROSITA results. With all three CHIME/FRB Outriggers now operating, the host galaxy sample is growing rapidly, enabling many new opportunities to probe the invisible universe.
