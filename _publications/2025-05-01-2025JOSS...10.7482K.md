**Abstract**

pyuvdata is an open-source software package that seeks to provide a well-documented, feature-rich interface for many of the different data formats that exist within radio interferometry, including support for reading and writing the following formats: UVH5 [@uvh5], UVFITS [@uvfits], MIRIAD [@miriad], and measurement set [@ms] visibility files. It offers read-only support for fast holographic deconvolution [FHD, @fhd] and MIR [@mir] visibility save files. Additionally, pyuvdata supports reading/writing measurement set, CalFITS [@calfits], and CalH5 [@calh5] calibration solutions; and reading of FHD calibration solutions. pyuvdata also provides interfaces for and handling of models of antenna primary beams, including BeamFITS [read and write, @beamfits], CST (read-only) and MWA beam formats (read-only). It also provides interfaces for handling of data flags.
